abstract = {Even though membrane technology is used in numerous industrial applications, membrane fouling is still a major challenge. Valuable information on the formation kinetics and structure of the fouling layer can be obtained by in situ real-time monitoring. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) enables the study of adsorptive fouling in situ on a model membrane. However, so far, there has been no in-depth investigation as to what extent observations from QCM-D relate to fouling during membrane filtration. This gap is here approached by comparing membrane fouling during ultrafiltration with QCM-D measurements using the same feed (process water from thermomechanical pulping) and the same material in the polymer film as in the membrane (hydrophilized polysulfone). The performance at two temperatures (25 °C and 50 °C) was studied. Fouling was analyzed by flux measurements, changes in frequency and dissipation over time with QCM-D, and surface characterization of the membrane samples and QCM-D sensors. QCM-D revealed an increase in rigidity of the fouling layer at 50 °C with time, which was consistent with a higher irreversible resistance during ultrafiltration. This was presumably caused by structural changes of hemicelluloses and colloidal wood extractive droplets in the process water at the higher temperature. The study shows that findings from QCM-D on the attachment of foulants on polymer films are comparable to membrane fouling. Thus, QCM-D, together with complementary analytical methods, can provide valuable insights on the development of membrane fouling of e.g., industrial wastewater.}

abstract = {Hypersaline environments are ubiquitous in nature and are found in myriad technological processes. Recent empirical studies have revealed a significant discrepancy between predicted and observed screening lengths at high salt concentrations{,} a phenomenon referred to as underscreening. Herein we investigate underscreening using a cationic polyelectrolyte brush as an exemplar. Poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)trimethylammonium (PMETAC) brushes were synthesised and their internal structural changes and swelling response was monitored with neutron reflectometry and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Both techniques revealed a monotonic brush collapse as the concentration of symmetric monovalent electrolyte increased. However{,} a non-monotonic change in brush thickness was observed in all multivalent electrolytes at higher concentrations{,} known as re-entrant swelling; indicative of underscreening. For all electrolytes{,} numerical self-consistent field theory predictions align with experimental studies in the low-to-moderate salt concentration regions. Analysis suggests that the classical theory of electrolytes is insufficient to describe the screening lengths observed at high salt concentrations and that the re-entrant polyelectrolyte brush swelling seen herein is consistent with the so-called regular underscreening phenomenon.},

abstract = {Pertinent to cryopreservation as well as energy storage and batteries, nonaqueous electrolytes and their mixtures with water were investigated. In particular, specific ion-induced effects on the modulation of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brush were investigated in various dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–water solvent mixtures. Spectroscopic ellipsometry and neutron reflectometry were employed to probe changes in brush swelling and structure, respectively. In water-rich solvents (i.e., pure water and 6 mol % DMSO), PNIPAM undergoes a swollen to collapsed thermotransition with increasing temperature, whereby a forward Hofmeister series was noted; K+ and Li+ electrolytes composed of SCN– and I– salted-in (stabilized) PNIPAM chains, and electrolytes of Cl– and Br– salted-out (destabilized) the polymer. The cation was seen to play a lesser role than that of the anion, merely modulating the magnitude of the anion effect. In 70 mol % DMSO, a collapsed to swollen thermotransition was noted for PNIPAM. Here, concentration-dependent specific ion effects were observed; a forward series was observed in 0.2 mol % electrolytes, whereas increasing the electrolyte concentration to 0.9 mol % led to a series reversal. While no thermotransition was observed in pure DMSO, a solvent-induced specific ion series reversal was noted; SCN– destabilized the brush and Cl– stabilized the brush. Both series reversals are attributed to the delicate balance of interactions between the solvent, solute (ion), and substrate (brush). Namely, the stability of the solvent clusters was hypothesized to drive polymer solvation.},

abstract = {Cosolvents play an integral role in polymer solubility, with myriad applications in drug delivery and energy storage. In particular, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has received substantial attention to date due to its cryoprotective properties and interesting nonideal mixing behaviour. Here, for the first time, we probe the fundamentals of DMSO–water solvent structuring using a thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropoylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brush as an exemplar. Spectroscopic ellipsometry and neutron reflectometry were employed to monitor changes in brush swelling and conformation as a function of temperature and solvent composition, whereby changes in solvent structure can be deduced. Importantly, unlike free polymer, grafted polymers permit measurements across the entire solvent composition space, including ‘poor' solvent conditions, permitting the characterisation of polymers in complex media for future technologies. In the water-rich regime, the prevalent hydrogen-bond network resulted in the PNIPAM brush exhibiting a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) up to DMSO mole fractions of 0.10 (xD = 0.10), which decreased with increasing xD; DMSO is a chaotropic cosolvent. This region was adjacent to a cononsolvency region. Interestingly, reentrant swelling was observed for above approximately xD = 0.2. In DMSO-rich regimes, non-site-specific dipole–dipole interactions resulted in the PNIPAM brush exhibiting an uppercritical solution temperature (UCST), whereby the periphery of the swollen brush was more diffuse than at low xD. At all temperatures, pure DMSO is a good solvent for PNIPAM and no thermoresponse was observed. Herein we demonstrate how the structure and swelling of a polymer brush film can be modulated by tuning solvent composition by mixing two ‘good' solvents.},

    abstract = {Diffuse soft matter interfaces take many forms, from end-tethered polymer brushes or adsorbed surfactants to self-assembled layers of lipids. These interfaces play crucial roles across a multitude of fields, including materials science, biophysics, and nanotechnology. Understanding the nanostructure and properties of these interfaces is fundamental for optimising their performance and designing novel functional materials. In recent years, reflectometry techniques, in particular neutron reflectometry, have emerged as powerful tools for elucidating the intricate nanostructure of soft matter interfaces with remarkable precision and depth. This review provides an overview of selected recent developments in reflectometry and their applications for illuminating the nanostructure of diffuse interfaces. We explore various principles and methods of neutron and X-ray reflectometry, as well as ellipsometry, and discuss advances in their experimental setups and data analysis approaches. Improvements to experimental neutron reflectometry methods have enabled greater time resolution in kinetic measurements and elucidation of diffuse structure under shear or confinement, while innovation in analysis protocols has significantly reduced data processing times, facilitated co-refinement of reflectometry data from multiple instruments and provided greater-than-ever confidence in proposed structural models. Furthermore, we highlight some significant research findings enabled by these techniques, revealing the organisation, dynamics, and interfacial phenomena at the nanoscale. We also discuss future directions and potential advancements in reflectometry techniques. By shedding light on the nanostructure of diffuse interfaces, reflectometry techniques enable the rational design and tailoring of interfaces with enhanced properties and functionalities.}
